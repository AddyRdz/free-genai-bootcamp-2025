            * Notice that you used the present tense "vamos" (we go) but the sentence refers to yesterday
            * When talking about completed actions in the past, you need to use the preterite tense
            * The verb "ir" is irregular in the preterite tense
            * The rest of your sentence is correct - good use of "la" with "playa"

            * "Ir" (to go) is an irregular verb in the preterite (past) tense
            * The preterite forms don't follow the regular pattern you might expect
            * Think about how to say "I went," "you went," "he/she went," etc.
            * Many common Spanish verbs are irregular in the preterite
            * Try to recall the pattern for this specific verb, as it's used frequently
