     - BAD: The beginner sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table.
     - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
     - BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this. [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-Past]? 
     </score_reasons>

Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. We'll start with the vocabulary.
| Spanish    | English |
| los osos   |	bears |
| la puerta  |	door |
| Â¿dejar?    |	to leave |
| la basura  |	garbage |
Now, think about the sentence structure. We have two parts to the sentence:
"Bears are at the door" - This is a statement. Think about how you would say "bears" and "are" in Spanish.
"Did you leave the garbage out?" - This is a question. Think about how you would form a question in Spanish using the verb "to leave".
What's your attempt at translating the sentence into Spanish?

     - GOOD: Doesn't provide verbose text at the start, and shows vocabulary immediately.
     - GOOD: Shows conceptual sentence structure.
     - GOOD: Clues don't give away any of the tense of conjugations

2. A verb (are) in the present tense 
3. A location phrase (at the door)
4. A question structure for the second part (did you leave...)
